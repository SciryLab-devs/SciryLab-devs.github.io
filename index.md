### About us
<p>
  <h5>Let's start with the name of our Start-up.</h5>
  <p><strong>Sciry</strong> is an English word which is not widespread at all and which means according to its origin <strong><em>a person who is talented in multiple skills</em></strong></p>
</p>
            
<p>
    <h5>Why this choice ?</h5>
    <p>The talented person in question is indeed a legal entity, i.e. our Start-up<br/>
    As a result, he/she has several skills in a wide variety of fields.
    Each skill is intrinsic to a person of the SciryLab team if you have understood the concept.</p>
    <p>According to the same origin, <strong><em>a sciry is always working hard to reach his/her goals</em></strong> <br/>
    A key characteristic and a philosophy that we advocate at SciryLab :
    <strong>nwe work hard to give life & smile to our customers' project.</strong></br>
